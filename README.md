# Puzzles Lib

A Minecraft mod. This version of Puzzles Lib by Fuzs is designed specifically to be compatible with a backport of Straw Statues to 1.18. Please note that this backport is *messy* and you should not expect Fuzs to support it. It's maintained solely for the purpose of inclusion in one of my upcoming modpacks.

# Multi-Loader Project

This repository is built from a [multi-loader template](https://github.com/jaredlll08/MultiLoader-Template) made by [Jaredlll08](https://github.com/jaredlll08).

This allows for developing a mod on multiple mod loaders at the same time and in a very convenient way without having too much duplicated code whilst also not requiring any additional dependencies or frameworks.

This project uses Quilt for the common project instead of VanillaGradle to be able to make use of [QuiltFlower](https://github.com/QuiltMC/quiltflower) (although this is actually also possible with Fabric Loom using [LoomQuiltflower](https://github.com/Juuxel/LoomQuiltflower) as I found out later).
